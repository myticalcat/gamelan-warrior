    dialog|Hope woke up from his sleep feeling confused.

    dialog|He
    wondered if his dream last night was just an imagination or a way out of the
    curse.

    dialog|However, behind that, Hope felt something was different.

    dialog|He
    felt the burden on his mind and head had disappeared, as if everything was fine.

    dialog|In
    fact, without realizing it, Hope actually has saved the entire village.

    dialog|No
    nightmare terrors and no more scary sleep.

    dialog|Living comfortably and
    safely no longer feels impossible.

    dialog|Hope, as the name means hope,
    had become a light of hope for the villagers.
